# Archive - Learning Journey Documentation

This folder contains phase-by-phase implementation guides and internal documentation from the project development process.

**Purpose:** Preserves the learning journey and problem-solving process without cluttering the main repository.

## Contents

- **LUCID_AI_PROMPT.md** - Guide for creating architecture diagrams
- **ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md** - ASCII art architecture (superseded by visual diagram)

## Why Keep This?

These documents show:
- Methodical approach to complex problems
- Documentation discipline throughout development
- Actual problem-solving process (not just final result)
- Useful for future reference or similar projects

**Note:** These files are not essential for running the project. See main `/docs` folder for operational documentation.
