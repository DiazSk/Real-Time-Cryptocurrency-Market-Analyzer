# Type should be one of:
#   feat:     A new feature
#   fix:      A bug fix
#   docs:     Documentation only changes
#   style:    Changes that don't affect code meaning (formatting, etc)
#   refactor: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   perf:     A code change that improves performance
#   test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#   chore:    Changes to build process or auxiliary tools
#
# Scope is optional but recommended (kafka, flink, docker, api, etc)
#
# Subject line:
#   - Use imperative mood ("add feature" not "added feature")
#   - Don't capitalize first letter
#   - No period at the end
#   - Keep under 50 characters
#
# Body:
#   - Explain WHAT and WHY (not HOW)
#   - Wrap at 72 characters
#   - Separate from subject with blank line
#
# Footer:
#   - Reference issues: "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456"
#   - Breaking changes: "BREAKING CHANGE: description"
#
# Examples:
#   feat(kafka): add dual-listener configuration
#   fix(docker): resolve networking issue with Kafka UI
#   docs(readme): update Phase 2 progress tracker
